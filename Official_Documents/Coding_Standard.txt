- Use snake case for variable names with spaces for readability: (ex. snake_case = 123)
- Use comment blocks above methods explaining its purpose and why you implemented the way you did. 
    ex. 
    */ 
        comments 
        comments 
        */ 

- Avoid in-line styling for clarity.
- When doing CSS, keep similiar blocks together
