As defined by dev team: 

Is it SMART?

Do we have a specific end-product in mind for each task?

Can we measure what the task contributes to the end goal? 

Do we have achievable expectations for each task?

Is the work done relevant to the needed end-product?

Is it done within the bounds of the sprint?
